🚀 Phase 1: Core API Foundation
Goal: Build the payment engine’s backbone.

- Set up Node.js + Fastify project
  - Initialize repo with TypeScript support.
  - Define routes for /payments, /webhooks, /auth, /transactions.
- Integrate GraphQL
  - Use Apollo Server or Mercurius (Fastify plugin).
  - Define schema for payments, users, merchants, and events.
- Add basic auth (OAuth2)
  - Use Passport.js or Auth0 for now.
  - Secure endpoints with token-based access.

📦 Phase 5: Containerization & Deployment
Goal: Make it portable and scalable.

- Dockerize backend and frontend
  - Use multi-stage builds for performance.
- Deploy to cloud
  - Start with Railway, Render, or Vercel for MVP.
  - Later migrate to AWS/GCP with Kube
