PayCraft Microcopy Design System

This document defines the voice, tone, and microcopy standards for PayCraft’s UI/UX. It ensures consistency across tooltips, error messages, success confirmations, and empty states.

🎯 Principles

Developer-first: Clear, concise, technical-friendly language.

Confident but neutral: Avoid jargon, reassure users.

Action-oriented: Guide users toward next steps.

Accessible: Ensure tooltips and messages are screen-reader friendly.
