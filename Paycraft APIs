PayCraft API Ecosystem

PayCraft aims to be a developer-first payment engine for Africa, inspired by Stripe but tailored to local realities. To achieve this, it needs a robust set of APIs that cover the full payment lifecycle, compliance, and developer experience.

🔑 Core API Categories

1. Payments API

Purpose: Handle transaction flows (cards, mobile money, bank transfers).

Functions: Initiate charges, refunds, reversals, split payments.

How it works: Abstracts complex integrations with banks, card networks, and mobile money providers.

2. Payouts/Disbursement API

Purpose: Send money to vendors, gig workers, or partners.

Functions: Schedule payouts, bulk disbursements, status tracking.

How it works: Automates sending funds to multiple recipients across local rails.

3. Wallets & Accounts API

Purpose: Manage virtual accounts or wallets.

Functions: Create wallets, transfer funds, balance inquiry.

How it works: Acts as a ledger, enabling businesses to hold and move funds before settlement.

4. Identity & KYC API

Purpose: Verify users and businesses for compliance.

Functions: ID verification, business registration checks, AML screening.

How it works: Integrates with government or third-party verification services.

5. Developer Tools API

Purpose: Enhance developer experience.

Functions: Webhooks, sandbox/test environments, API keys & authentication.

How it works: Provides smooth DX with test environments and event-driven integrations.

6. Analytics & Reporting API

Purpose: Provide insights into transactions.

Functions: Transaction history, settlement reports, fraud detection signals.

How it works: Enables businesses to build dashboards and automate reconciliation.

7. Integration APIs (Local Rails)

Purpose: Connect PayCraft to Africa’s fragmented payment ecosystem.

Examples: Mobile money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money), bank APIs, card networks.

How it works: Acts as a unified layer, simplifying integrations.

⚙️ How They Work Together

Payments API moves money in.

Payouts API moves money out.

Wallets API holds money in between.
